# **App Name**: Aqua Insights

## Core Features:

- Data Ingestion: Automated ingestion of oceanographic, fisheries, taxonomic, otolith morphology, and molecular biodiversity datasets.
- Cross-Domain Correlation: Perform cross-disciplinary correlation analysis to study relationships between ocean parameters, biodiversity, fish distribution, and ecosystem health using a tool to filter datasets and LLM to refine search.
- Otolith Visualizer: Interactive visualization module for otolith shape and morphometrics analysis.
- Taxonomic Assistant: Taxonomic classification and species identification tool that utilizes the curated knowledge to help identify an unknown species and display potential habitats of that species.
- eDNA Data Module: Secure storage, retrieval, and species matching for molecular and eDNA data.
- Interactive Ocean Viewer: Interactive map displaying visualisations of different aspects of oceanography and marine biology. A looping background video shows footage of the deep ocean behind the other controls.
- Data Export: Enables users to easily download selected datasets in standard formats for further analysis.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Sea Blue (#2979FF) for a sense of depth and mystery.
- Background color: Dark Navy (#1A237E), a muted and desaturated variant of the primary color for comfortable contrast.
- Accent color: Bioluminescent Green (#64DD17) to highlight interactive elements and key data points, drawing inspiration from deep-sea organisms.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif for clean, modern readability.
- Use minimalist, outline-style icons to represent various data types and functions. The icons should be simple, clear, and easily recognizable, using the Bioluminescent Green as an accent.
- Implement a modular layout with clear sections for data input, visualization, and analysis. Prioritize a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user engagement. For example, use smooth transitions when switching between different data views.
